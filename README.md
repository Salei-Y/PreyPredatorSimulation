# Prey Predator Simulation

The program is designed using an object-oriented approach and simulates an ocean ecosystem. Project includes objects such as predators, prey, and obstacles. These objects interact with each other based on specific rules.

The project displays a table ('ocean') to the user, filled with cells. The ocean is updated at regular intervals, during which each cell performs actions specific to its behavior.

During the project, I learned to work with object-oriented programming, applied knowledge of working with classes in practice, gained experience using libraries, became familiar with class diagrams, and learned the basics of working with GitHub.
